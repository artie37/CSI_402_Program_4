Program-4:
This is a program that will implement an assembler for a hypothetical computer called TMIPS. The program will take a text file at the command line that contains the TMIPS program.

If the TMIPS program does not contain syntax erros, the program will produce two files, one file containing the object code and the other file containing the symbol table. If there are syntax errors, the program will produce only one file containing the errors.
